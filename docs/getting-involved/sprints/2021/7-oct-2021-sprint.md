### Project Goals
* Build "real" events for sample, demo and testing data
* Work through the Appointments Object and call out potential issues
* Update areas that need help text because it isn't sufficient and/or functionality is unexplained
* Create a widget/LWC for Add to Calendar link on the Confirmation page


### Project Team Accomplishments
* Created some real sample events that we'll pull into a single place for more intentional and time efficient testing
* Got fresh eyes on the project where unexplained functionality was called out, as well as help text updates needed
* Progress towards putting a LWC on a VF Page for the Add to Calendar links
* Walked through Email process for a start to improved documentation on emails
* Called out issues and error with the Appointment Type and expected functionality
* Create a new branch to capture updates from October Sprint
