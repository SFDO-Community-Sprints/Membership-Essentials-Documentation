# October 2022 - Virtual Mini-Sprint
The Summit Events App Team, Community Volunteers and Users of the application came together for a 4-hour mini-sprint to tackle more of the documentation needs. Each Contributer listed below took an [issue](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/summit-events-app-documentation/issues) and worked through getting "pencil on paper" to provide Summit Event Users an opporunity to understand the tools functionality and how to solve potential use cases.

A major THANK YOU to the contirubtors of the mini-sprint for their dedication and time to continuing to make Summit Events a meaningful community application.  We look forward to more contributing to the project and supporting the Salesforce.org community.
