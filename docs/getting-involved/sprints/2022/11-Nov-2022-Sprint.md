# November 2022 - San Francisco Sprint (Hybrid)
The Open Source Commons & Community Sprints hosted the first in-person sprint since 2019! The Summit Events team was represented and piloted a hybrid experience, allowing for in-person and virtual attendence. Because the decision to go hybrid was made late, they were unable to promote the virtual option.

A major THANK YOU to the contirubtors of the sprint for their dedication and time to continuing to make Summit Events a meaningful community application.  We are excited with the progress made and look forward to taking action on the outcomes outlined below.
