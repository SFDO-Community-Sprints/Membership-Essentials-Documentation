The Salesforce.org Commons is a community of mission-driven individuals working together to solve the world's most challenging problems. We do this by actively listening to each other, educating each other, and bringing our passion, experience, and technical know-how to projects that can be replicated and shared throughout the Salesforce ecosystem. We work to remove barriers to entry so that everyone can be a part of this vision.
