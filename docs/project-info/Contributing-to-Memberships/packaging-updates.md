# Packaging Updates
* Since Summit Events is a managed package, we will review contributions on a monthly basis per the [Monthly Meeting agenda](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/summit-events-app-documentation/docs/project-info/process-repo-definition/monthly-meetings/).
* Per the [Repository Definition](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/summit-events-app-documentation/docs/project-info/process-repo-definition/repository-definitions/#summit-events-repo), the Main Branch will have the latest updates until packaged.
* Communication on updates will appear in the [Power of Us Hub](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/groups/0F94S000000kHi2SAE?tab=discussion&sort=LAST_MODIFIED_DATE_DESC).
