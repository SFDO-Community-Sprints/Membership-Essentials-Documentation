# Creating a Basic Event

![CreateBasicEventOverviewImage](images/CreateBasicEvent_Overview.png)  
<br/>
The first step in setting up a brand new event is to create a Summit Event record and an Event Instance record.  Summit Events are parent records to Summit Event Instance records.  You cannot have a Summit Event instance without it being tied to a parent Summit Event record.  Summit Event instance records inherit much of the information from the parent Summit Event record.  This document covers the fields needed when creating a basic event.
