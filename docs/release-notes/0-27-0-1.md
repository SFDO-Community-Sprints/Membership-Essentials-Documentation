## Known Issues

### [#410 - Upgrading removes Default Label on Existing Event Records](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/410) (Won't Fix)

**Summary**

When Upgrading from .26 to .27.0.1, one of the new features is the ability to control field labels on the standard questions. Because of the new feature, the existing event records don't automatically have the default field labels which are identified at the time of Event record creation.

**Reproduce**

1. Create a new Event prior to upgrading Summit Events
2. Upgrade .26 to .27.0.1
3. Review the recently or exisiting event record
4. Go to the Field Labels

**Workaround**
1. Import the default fields via dataloader or Import Wizard with a Event Records.
2. [Summit.Events.Default.Field.Labels.csv template](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/summit-events-app-documentation/files/8847091/Summit.Events.Default.Field.Labels.csv)
3. Create a report with Event Ids
4. Add Event ID to the template and copy down all of the default field label
5. Utilizing Dataloader or Import Wizard update the event records and match on the Event ID



### [#413 - Global Picklist Values on Question Object](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/413) (Resolved)

**Summary**

Global Picklists are not accessible when the custom question is set to a picklist field type and a Registrant Type of "Registrant".

**Reproduce**

1. Create a custom question with a field type of "Picklist"
2. Set the Registrant Type to "Registrant"
3. Select an "Existing Pikclist Value" where the picklist has a Global Value Set associated to it
4. Try to see the page on when registering

**Workaround**

Current workaround is to create a custom picklist on the question record that matches the list you're trying to offer.



### [#414 - Registrant Type = "Registrant and Guest"](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/414) (Resolved)

**Summary**

When Registrant Type has a value of "Registrant and Guest", it does not offer the additional questions page in addition to the guest registrant page.

**Reproduce**

1. Create a Custom Question record with an Registrant Type of "Registrant and Guest"
2. Complete the rest of the fields for the Registrant to be able to answer the custom question on the Additional Question page
3. Be sure the Event record is display Guest to test that this works for Guest Registrations
4. Notice the skipped pages

**Workaround**

Create Registrant and Guest questions seperately by using the "clone" button while on your originally created record and  change the Registrant Type on the cloned record so you have dual records focused on difference audiences.
