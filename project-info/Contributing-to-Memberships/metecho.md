# Metecho 
Metecho is a Heroku app that works with the Summit Events GitHub repository.  It has its own [Github Repository](https://github.com/SFDO-Tooling/Metecho). Metecho is the Summit Events web-based tool with the intention of it being used for:
* Creating short time Salesforce scratch orgs that have Summit Events pre-installed.
* Admin and Developer collaboration on completing and testing project backlog tasks and issues. 
* Managing all in progress and completed changes, including development and testing efforts, status and notes.
* Developing with CLICKS, NOT CODE!

### Development, Testing and Learning
In Metecho, you can either create a scratch org to test the application or learn how it works. You can also create a branch, contributing towards the development of the project.  Depending on your purpose you'll want to follow the appropriate steps below:

#### Creating a Scratch Org Only (No Development)
1. From the main page, click on the "Create Scratch Org" button under "My Project Scratch Org" on the right side of the screen.
2. This will create a scratch org that you can utilize to learn and test the Summit Events App from the main branch.

#### Creating a Branch & Scratch Org
1. From the main menu, you can see other scratch orgs that have been created.
1. To create a new scratch org, click "Task" tab and select "Create a Task".
1. Give your Task a name and description, which will label your branch and articulating what you're goal is.
1. Once the task is created, select "Assign" on the Developer window.
1. Assign yourself as the Developer and hit "save".
1. You will see a new window where you can select "Create Org".  It will take a couple minutes to create the org, but this org will have Summit Events installed and configured.  There will also be sample data so you can start making edits and changes to your branch.

### Accessing your Metecho Org

1. To get back to your org, log into Metecho and select the Summit Events repository. 
1. Find your Task in the list, then click on the Task name.
1. Click “View org”.

### Adding Collaborators
<b>Best practice</b>: the "Developer" is the person working on the change, and the "Tester" should be someone else that can review, validate and approve the change meets requirements.

1. Click “Add or Remove Collaborators” to find the people who will be working with you on this project. It will show everyone who is authorized to use Metecho and the names displayed are GitHub usernames. 
1. Check the box next to the names of your collaborators, then click “Save”.
1. To assign roles on the tasks, click on the person icon under the role.
1. Click the person you want to assign to the role, then click “Save”.


### Submit Changes for Testing and Review
1. Once you have completed making your changes in your scratch org, it needs to be reviewed by some else. Navigate to the Metecho task you were working on. The status will show that there are unretrieved changes.
1. Click “Retrieve Changes from Dev Org”.
1. Select the “force-app” directory, then “Save & Next”.
1. Review your changes, and select the ones you want to have reviewed.  **Do NOT include any Profiles as Summit Events does not utilize Profiles.**
1. Update the "Commit Message" to provide detail on the changes you made and what they should review, then click “Retrieve Selected Changes”.
1. The window will close, and Metecho will begin processing your request. Depending on the changes made, this could take a few minutes.
1. When complete, the message will update to “up to date”, and a blue button will appear at the top. Click the “Submit Task for Testing” button.
1. Fill in all of the requested fields on the Submit this task for testing screen, then click “Submit Task for Testing”.
1. The Tester you designated for this Task will receive an email with their notes and a link to the Metecho task so they can create their own scratch org that includes your changes.  
> Be sure to clearly articulate what you want the person testing to test so they can make appropriate comments related to those changes.
> NOTE: The Tester CANNOT make changes in their org for retrieval.

### Reviewing and Testing Changes as a Tester
1. While in the Task, click the “Create Org” button in the Tester window to create a new scratch org with the related changes.
1. Once the scratch org creation is complete, click “Test Changes in Org” to open the scratch org.
1. After you have completed your review of the changes, return to the Metecho Task screen and click the “Submit Review” button.
