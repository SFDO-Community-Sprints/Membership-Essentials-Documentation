# Making a new Package/Release:
To create a new package accessible in the [Open Source Commons](https://install.salesforce.org/products/SummitEventsApp/latest), the following 3 questions need to be answered:
- Do we have the minimum viable documentation for all new elements being packaged?
- Do we have any critical features or bugs that need to be packaged?
- Is there enough there to create a package? (This will be based on conversation and a review of what’s in Main)

If the above questions are answered in a way that leads to creating a new package, the Summit Events Team will work in conjunction with Salesforce.org and the Open Source and Community Sprints to release a new version. To do so the following steps will be required:
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3
4. Step 4... .
