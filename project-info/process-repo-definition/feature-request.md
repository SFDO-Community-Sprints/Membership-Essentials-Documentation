# Feature Request Process
The following reflects the ideal feature request process:
1. All new Feature Requests are first shared in the [Trailblazer Community](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/groups/0F94S000000kHi2SAE). This is to capture some commmunity feedback on interest as well as some initial requirements.
2. An individual on the Summit Events App Team creates Feature Request Issue in Github following the template, capturing some initial requirements while articulating some expectations.
3. The Feature Request is reviewed by the Summit Events App team and technical specs are created, adding to the Issue created.
4. The Feature Request Issue is assigned to an individual or a request is made to the community for support on development of the Feature Request.
5. The assigned “Developer” will document and articulate their solution as part of their process, ensuring testers can recreate it and working as expected to based on the initial request and technical specs.
6. Once developlment is complete and ready for a Pull Request, the rest of the [Review Process](https://sfdo-community-sprints.github.io/summit-events-app-documentation/docs/project-info/process-repo-definition/repository-definitions/#developmentreview-of-branches) will follow.
