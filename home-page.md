# What is Membership Done Better?

Membership Done Better is a sustainable open source community membership app that serves a broad variety of needs for NGOs. The membership solution has the flexibility needed to offer memberships of different types: paid, free, group, guests, and individual. It will also offer adjacent donations.  The solution will include the full life cycle of the membership: registration, payment tracking, confirmation, renewals, reporting and web faced exposure. This solution will be compatible with Salesforce Data Architectures.
