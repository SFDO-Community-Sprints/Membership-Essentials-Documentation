# What is Membership Done Better?

The Membership Done Better is a sustainable open source community events app that serves a broad variety of needs for EDUs and NGOs. The event solution has the flexibility needed to offer events of different types: paid, free, group, guests, and individual. The solution will include the full life cycle of the event: registration, receipting, confirmation, reporting and web faced exposure. This solution facilitates a Salesforce connected campus and will be compatible with Salesforce.orgâ€™s Data Architectures.
